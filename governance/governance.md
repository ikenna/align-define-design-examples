# Vision 

To enable API designers and API owners build high quality API products in a fast, scalable way and give API consumers a great integration experience.


# Mission

A. To facilitate the creation of APIs that are discoverable, complete, consistent, reusable, extensible, secure and regulatory compliant.  
B. Maintain a holistic API catalogue and manage an efficient API delivery worklow.  
C. Provide API standards, training, resources, support, coaching and support for feature teams in API design. 

## Maintaining a holistic API catalogue
To fulfill this we will maintain a holistic API catalogue in a desginated system of record that includes:
1. API design specification files (OpenAPI, GraphQL, Async API, gRPC proto etc)
2. Business and technical capability taxonomies
3. Resource model taxonomies
4. Business glossary
5. API product profile definitions
6. API mappings, orchestrations and transformations
7. API guide documentation
8. Other API metadata

This will enable our APIs to be 
1. abstracted away from code 
2. discoverable, reusable and help minimize duplicatin
3. understandable to non-engineering stakeholders
4. provide a view for regulatory and compliance reporting
5. be a reliable source of truth
6. a springboard to accelerate innovation 
7. aligned to business goals

# Values

We value:
- Inclusive, collaborative API design over exclusive siloed design efforts. 
- Consumer-centric, product-driven API designs over provider-centric, technology-driven API designs.
- Federated coaching and enabling self-service over centralised enforcement.  
- Automated over manual governance checks.  
_While there may be value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more._

# Principles
1. Champion centralised enterprise governance wide rules with managed exceptions. 
2. Automate governance and validation checks for speed and enablement
3. Manage APIs as abstracted designs in a holistic catalogue, with business capability and digital resource model taxonomies. 
4. Apply governance at all stages of the API lifecycle
5. Effectively manage API versioning. Support semantic versioning.
